== Tips & Tricks

=== Debugging

[TIP]
====
kbd:[Shift+Click] on colors in chrome dev-tools switches presentation mode (hex, rgb, hsl)

Commented out styles still appear in the browser's debugger to toggle

https://github.com/andreadev-it/stacking-contexts-inspector[Stacking dev-tools]
====

=== Mobile Styles

[TIP]
====
Apllying full screen height with `100vh` causes unexpected behavour on mobile devices, as loading bars and scroll bars count into the `vh` as well.

.Solution:
[source,css]
----
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}

.full-height-container {
  min-height: 100%; /* Takes full height of its parent's height */
}
----
====

==== Scroll Effects

Applying scroll effect only to one part of the application by defining the scroll container height by sibling: (See https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/04-flexbox/11-flex-interactions#combining-layout-modes[Module 4])

video::assets/videos/flex-absolute-child.mp4[align=center,width=400]

[source,css]
----
.outer-container {
    /* align items next to each other + define height by children */
    display: flex;
    /* handle scroll effect for scrolling-element */
    overflow: auto;
}

.scrolling-element {
    /* all content overflows -> height of parent not affected by this element */
    height: 0;
}

.main-content {
    /* appears to be static as it defines the containers height + sticks while scrolling */
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
}
----

== Fundamentals Recap

=== Accessibility (https://a11y.coffee/[a11y])

[TIP]
=====
.Use `rem` for font-sizes and `px` for spacings
[%collapsible]
====
_Assumption: Users scale for better readability of text-content +
When scaling, `px` will remain (spacings) and `rem` will scale._
====
=====

[IMPORTANT]
=====
.Don't use `outline: none` for styles
[%collapsible]
====
_It prevents a proper tabbing_
====

.Placeholders should not contain critical information
[%collapsible]
====
_Information will be gone as soon as user enters data._
====

.`<html>` tag should not receive a custom font-size
[%collapsible]
====
_This will override a user's chosen default font size._
====

.`line-height: <number>` should be at least 1.5
[%collapsible]
====
_The calculated value is:_ `element font size * value`

== Rendering

[NOTE]
=====
Most of the https://www.sitepoint.com/css-inheritance-introduction/#list-css-properties-inherit[properties that inherit] are typography-related (color, font, line-height, …)

=====

=== Margins

> Margin is like putting glue on something before you’ve decided what to stick it to, or if it should be stuck to anything.
[NOTE]

=====
`margin-[top/bottom/left/right]` is influenced by left-to-right languages. +
`margin-[block/inline]-[start/end]` Would be the correct alternative.

Margins of parent & children collapse (<<margin-collapse, show more>>)

Padding/Border/hr between vertical margins prevents collapsing

.https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin/[Margin considered harmful]
[%collapsible]
====
_By banning margin from all components you have to build more reusable and encapsulated components.
Use a combination of padding and layout components instead_
====

`margin: auto` is still valid to center only selected children (compared to grid/flexbox center logic)
=====

[#margin-collapse]
==== Margin Collapse

TIP: Margins only collapse in flow layout

* Only block direction margins (e.g, usually vertical margin) collapse
* Only adjacent elements collapse
** Blocked by padding, border, gaps, and elements between (e.g `<hr />` or `<br />`)

image::margin-collapse-break.png[Line break prevents collapse,200,align="center"]

===== Calculate effective margins

* Margins can collapse in the same direction (the largest one wins)

image::margin-collapse-max.png[width=200,align=center]

* Multiple positive and negative margins are combined by
** Find the largest positive margin
** Find the largest negative margin
** Add those two numbers together

.Example
[%collapsible]
====
[source,html]
----
<header>
  <h1>My Project</h1>
</header>
<section>
  <p>Hello World</p>
</section>
----

[source,css]
----
header {
  margin-bottom: -20px; // most negative value
}

header h1 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

section {
  margin-top: -10px;
}

section p {
  margin-top: 30px; // most positive value
}

/*
effective margin
=> Max(10px, 30px) + Min(-20px, -10px)
=> 30px + (-20px)
=> 10px
*/
----
====

=== Dimensions

* `box-decoration-break: clone` handles multi-line inline element as separate segments -> spacings are applied to all segments.
* `max-width: min-content` solves figure (caption) width issues

NOTE: `width` takes the maximum space by default, `height` the minimum space

=== Positioning

* Flow layout isn't really built with layering in mind

* If an element is currently using positioned layout, and you want to opt out, you can set position to either `static` or `initial`

* If one sibling uses positioned layout, it will appear above its non-positioned sibling, no matter what the DOM order is.

* Positioned layout adds additional CSS properties (e.g., `top, left, right, bottom`)
* Difference to `margin`: These positions do not impact the layout +
In terms of flow layout, the browser acts like the element is still in its original position.
The displacement is purely cosmetic.
+
image::position-comparison.png[align=center]
* Can be applied to block and inline elements

==== Absolute positioning

* `position: absolute` is placed at its default in-flow position when no positioning is provided
* Center elements
+
[source,css]
----
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0px;
  left: 0px;
  right: 0px;
  bottom: 0px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: auto;
}
----
+
Alternative
+
[source,css]
----
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
----
* Containing element is the closest positioned ancestor

==== Stacking content

[NOTE]
====
`z-index` does not work in flow layouts (use positioned layout, flexbox or grid instead)

Positioned elements will always render on top of non-positioned ones

Each `z-index` creates an isolated stacking context for its descendants.
Wrapping content that stacks over others by accident into a stacking context can solve this issue.
====

[TIP]
====
Instead of creating a stacking context with `z-index`, modern browsers can use:

[source,css]
----
.stacking-container {
  isolation: isolate;
}
----
====

==== Fixed positioning

* Can only be contained by the viewport.
It doesn't care about containing blocks
* Sits at its flow position if no positioning is provided

WARNING: If a parent or grandparent uses the transform property, it becomes the containing block for the fixed element, essentially transforming it into an absolutely-positioned element

.Helper to detect ancestors that break `position: fixed`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,javascript]
----
const selector = '.the-fixed-child';
function findCulprits(elem) {
  if (!elem) {
    throw new Error(
      'Could not find element with that selector'
    );
  }
  let parent = elem.parentElement;
  while (parent) {
    const {
      transform,
      willChange
    } = getComputedStyle(parent);
    if (transform !== 'none' || willChange === 'transform') {
      console.warn(
        '🚨 Found a culprit! 🚨\n',
        parent,
        { transform, willChange }
      );
    }
    parent = parent.parentElement;
  }
}
findCulprits(document.querySelector(selector));
----
====

==== Overflow

WARNING: Scrollbars can look diferent on macOS based on having a wired mouse connected or not

When we set either overflow-x or overflow-y, we turn the selected element into a scroll container.
Children of a scroll container are essentially locked inside that box.

Essentially, `overflow: hidden` is an `overflow: scroll` container without the ability to scroll.

Absolute positioned elements ignore overflow properties of their ancestor elements. `overflow: auto` on the containing element solves this issue by scrolling inside of the container.

Fixed-position elements are immune from being hidden with `overflow: hidden`

==== Sticky positioning

When setting `position: sticky`, you also need to pick at least one edge to stick to (top, left, right, bottom).
Most commonly, this is done with `top: 0px`

Sticky elements take up real space, and that space remains taken even when the element is stuck to an edge during scrolling.

===== Troubleshooting

* A parent is hiding/managing overflow
** `position: sticky` can only stick in one "context".
Either it sticks to the main viewport scroll, or it sticks to an ancestor that manages overflow.
** Overflow `hidden` or `scroll` or `auto` sticks element in that context, not in the broader page context. *Check ancestors for this styling as well*

.Helper to detect ancestors that break `position: sticky` by some overflow styling
[%collapsible]
====
[source,javascript]
----
// Replace this with a relevant selector.
const selector = '.the-fixed-child';

function findCulprits(elem) {
  if (!elem) {
    throw new Error(
      'Could not find element with that selector'
    );
  }

  let parent = elem.parentElement;

  while (parent) {
    const hasOverflow = getComputedStyle(parent).overflow;
    if (hasOverflow !== 'visible') {
      console.log(hasOverflow, parent);
    }
    parent = parent.parentElement;
  }
}

findCulprits(document.querySelector(selector));
----
====

* The sticky element is stretched in flexbox/grid layout

* Thin gap above my sticky header
** Issue in Chrome due to rounding issues
+
[source,css]
----
header {
  position: sticky;
  top: -1px; /* -1px instead of 0px */
}
----

==== Hidden Content

* `visibility: hidden` can be selectively undone by children.
** All children take the space they need, but only selected ones are visible in the browser.

== Modern Component Architecture

=== Ways of styling applications

There are multiple ways of adding CSS to an application:

==== Vanilla CSS

.Pros
* No tooling means less complexity, no runtime performance costs
* CSS Custom Properties make certain tooling features redundant

.Cons
* Global and unscoped
* No vendor prefixes added
[#js-in-css]
* (_Can't share data between js and css_ 🤔)
+
.Caveat
[%collapsible]
====
Having a separation between application logic and styles in mind, passing data between js and css can lead to moving parts of the displaying logic into styled components rather than applying different styled components for different use cases.
Although this has no impact on the processed styles, the complexity and readability of the mixture between data and CSS might increase tremendously.
====

==== Sass / Less

.Pros
* Powerful tools like for-loops, mixins, and nesting
* High developer satisfaction compared with vanilla CSS

.Cons
* Requires a build step
* Remains global by nature, and isn't scoped to specific components
* Everything happens at build time

==== CSS Modules

.Pros
* Solves scoping and specificity
* Feels like writing straight-up CSS
* Offers a composes feature, to extend existing CSS classes

.Cons
* Doesn't really offer any modern convenience features, like auto prefixing (post processors needed to fix this)
* (_Hard to share data between CSS and JS_ - <<js-in-css, see Vanilla CSS cons>>)

==== Single-file components

.Pros
* Less jumping between files

.Cons
* Blows up files
* No file-based separation of styles & logic

==== Styled components

.Pros
* Solves scoping and specificity
* Offers good solutions for animations and global styles
* Extremely high developer satisfaction
* Best-in-class performance

.Cons
* Primarily a React tool
* Obfuscates the underlying markup tags, which can make it harder to get a sense of the HTML semantics at a glance

==== Tailwind (Utility first frameworks)

.Pros
* Solves scoping and specificity
* Encourages good habits when it comes to following a design system
* Can be faster to write
* Not React-specific (React based alternative: https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro[Twin])
* Highly used in the last few years

.Cons
* Relatively steep learning curve, compared to other tools
* Adds a lot of "bulk" to your markup

=== Styled Components - In Depth

* Sass-like preprocessor *stylis* adds vendor prefixes behind the scenes.
* Creates unique hash for each styled component -> no css class collisions
* https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/demystifying-styled-components/[Demistifying Styled Components]

TIP: Nested CSS (`&`) might come to https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting-1/[Vanilla CSS]

* https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/benchmarks/[Styling Variants Benchmarks]
* *Each added prop carries a significant and exponential cost in terms of complexity*
* Use compositions for variants that feel like not being generic ones
* Define contextual styles by "reaching out" to the sourrounding context
+
[%collapsible]
====
[source,typescript jsx]
----
const ButtonBase = styled.button`
  border-radius: 2px;

  ${ButtonGroup} & {
    border-radius: 0px;
  }
`;
----

_Contextual styles are defined next to the element to be styled (ButtonBase), rather than polluting the styled of the context (i.e., ButtonGroup)_
====
* When extending JSX-Components with a styled component, `className` has to be passed as a prop to the JSX-Component in order to apply the generated css class to its root-element

WARNING:  Only provide "core" options as props for styled components.
Too much options increase complexity dramatically.

.How to decide about "core" options?
****
If the Button component starts to feel too overwhelming, with too many options, consider extracting a couple composed variants to lighten the mental load.
****

== Flexbox

https://flexboxfroggy.com/[Flexbox Frog Game]

=== Basic Behaviour

* primary & cross axis
** justify-content styles primary axis
** align-items styles secondary axis
* width/height are more like hypothetical rules rather than strict styling
* Setting `width` in a flex row (or `height` in a flex column) sets the hypothetical size.
It isn't a guarantee, it's a suggestion
* `flex-basis` has the same effect as `width` in a flex row (height in a column).
You can use them interchangeably, *but `flex-basis` will win if there's a conflict*
* `flex: 1` will assign `flex-grow: 1`, but it will also set `flex-basis: 0%`.
It won't affect the default value for `flex-shrink`, which is 1

[NOTE]
====
`flex: shrink` can't shrink an item below its minimum content size.
If all the items are below their minimum content size, this property has no effect

To avoid issues between `flex` and `width` it is recommended to use the shorthand for flex in order to set the flex-basis explicitly:

.flex shorthand
[source,css]
----
.item {
/* grow | shrink | basis */
  flex: 1 1 200px;
}
----
====

[TIP]
====
Since flex-basis is a synonym for width in a flex row, we're effectively shrinking each child to have a “hypothetical width” of 0px, and then distributing all of the space between each child

.`flex-basis:0` causes growth to distribute all space evenly on elements (based on their ratio)
image::flex-distributions.jpeg[align=center,width=450]
====

* In a flex row, `flex-basis` works just like `width`, and it also respects the constraints set by `min-width` and `max-width`

=== Item vs. content

|===
|Item |Content

|Single element within flexbox container
|Group of items of a flexbox container
|===

=== Flexbox and z-index

Flexbox algorithm also supports z-index.
If our element is being laid out with Flexbox, it uses z-index as if it was rendered with positioned layout.

The same thing is true for CSS Grid; a child in Grid layout can use z-index without setting `position: relative`.
