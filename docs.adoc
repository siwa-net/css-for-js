== Tips & Tricks

=== Debugging

[TIP]
====
kbd:[Shift+Click] on colors in chrome dev-tools switches presentation mode (hex, rgb, hsl)

Commented out styles still appear in the browser's debugger to toggle

https://github.com/andreadev-it/stacking-contexts-inspector[Stacking dev-tools]
====

=== Mobile Styles

[TIP]
====
[#full-vertical-space]
Applying full screen height with `100vh` causes unexpected behavour on mobile devices, as loading bars and scroll bars count into the `vh` as well.

.Solution:
[source,css]
----
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}

.full-height-container {
  min-height: 100%; /* Takes full height of its parent's height */
}
----
====

=== Scroll Effects

Applying scroll effect only to one part of the application by defining the scroll container height by sibling: (See https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/04-flexbox/11-flex-interactions#combining-layout-modes[Module 4])

video::https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/course-materials/flex-absolute-child.mp4[align=center,width=400]

[source,css]
----
.outer-container {
    /* align items next to each other + define height by children */
    display: flex;
    /* handle scroll effect for scrolling-element */
    overflow: auto;
}

.scrolling-element {
    /* all content overflows -> height of parent not affected by this element */
    height: 0;
}

.main-content {
    /* appears to be static as it defines the containers height + sticks while scrolling */
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
}
----

== Others
* `@supports` queries help with applying styles only to supported browsers
+
[source, css]
----
@supports (aspect-ratio: 1 / 1) {
    img {
      height: revert;
      aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
    }
  }
----

== Fundamentals Recap

=== Accessibility (https://a11y.coffee/[a11y])
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh[A11y chrome extension]

[TIP]
=====
.Use `rem` for font-sizes and `px` for spacings
[%collapsible]
====
_Assumption: Users scale for better readability of text-content +
When scaling, `px` will remain (spacings) and `rem` will scale._
====
=====

[IMPORTANT]
=====
.Don't use `outline: none` for styles
[%collapsible]
====
_It prevents a proper tabbing_
====

.Placeholders should not contain critical information
[%collapsible]
====
_Information will be gone as soon as user enters data._
====

.`<html>` tag should not receive a custom font-size
[%collapsible]
====
_This will override a user's chosen default font size._
====

.`line-height: <number>` should be at least 1.5
[%collapsible]
====
_The calculated value is:_ `element font size * value`
====

== Rendering

[NOTE]
=====
Most of the https://www.sitepoint.com/css-inheritance-introduction/#list-css-properties-inherit[properties that inherit] are typography-related (color, font, line-height, …)

https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade[CSS specificity tutorial]
=====

=== Margins

> Margin is like putting glue on something before you’ve decided what to stick it to, or if it should be stuck to anything.
[NOTE]

=====
`margin-[top/bottom/left/right]` is influenced by left-to-right languages. +
`margin-[block/inline]-[start/end]` Would be the correct alternative.

Margins of parent & children collapse (<<margin-collapse, show more>>)

Padding/Border/hr between vertical margins prevents collapsing

.https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin/[Margin considered harmful]
[%collapsible]
====
_By banning margin from all components you have to build more reusable and encapsulated components.
Use a combination of padding and layout components instead_
====

`margin: auto` is still valid to center only selected children (compared to grid/flexbox center logic)
=====

[#margin-collapse]
==== Margin Collapse

TIP: Margins only collapse in flow layout

* Only block direction margins (e.g, usually vertical margin) collapse
* Only adjacent elements collapse
** Blocked by padding, border, gaps, and elements between (e.g `<hr />` or `<br />`)

image::margin-collapse-break.png[Line break prevents collapse,200,align="center"]

===== Calculate effective margins

* Margins can collapse in the same direction (the largest one wins)

image::margin-collapse-max.png[width=200,align=center]

* Multiple positive and negative margins are combined by
** Find the largest positive margin
** Find the largest negative margin
** Add those two numbers together

.Example
[%collapsible]
====
[source,html]
----
<header>
  <h1>My Project</h1>
</header>
<section>
  <p>Hello World</p>
</section>
----

[source,css]
----
header {
  margin-bottom: -20px; // most negative value
}

header h1 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

section {
  margin-top: -10px;
}

section p {
  margin-top: 30px; // most positive value
}

/*
effective margin
=> Max(10px, 30px) + Min(-20px, -10px)
=> 30px + (-20px)
=> 10px
*/
----
====

=== Dimensions

* `box-decoration-break: clone` handles multi-line inline element as separate segments -> spacings are applied to all segments.
* `max-width: min-content` solves figure (caption) width issues

NOTE: `width` takes the maximum space by default, `height` the minimum space

=== Positioning

* Flow layout isn't really built with layering in mind

* If an element is currently using positioned layout, and you want to opt out, you can set position to either `static` or `initial`

* If one sibling uses positioned layout, it will appear above its non-positioned sibling, no matter what the DOM order is.

* Positioned layout adds additional CSS properties (e.g., `top, left, right, bottom`)
* Difference to `margin`: These positions do not impact the layout +
In terms of flow layout, the browser acts like the element is still in its original position.
The displacement is purely cosmetic.
+
image::position-comparison.png[align=center]
* Can be applied to block and inline elements

==== Width Algorithms
* `width: min-content`: Content becomes as small as it can, based on the child contents
* `width: max-content`: Smallest value that contains the content, _without breaking it up_
* `width: fit-content`: Content width is based on the size of the children. If that width can fit within the parent container, it behaves just like `max-content`, not adding any line-breaks

==== Absolute positioning

* `position: absolute` is placed at its default in-flow position when no positioning is provided
* Center elements
+
[source,css]
----
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0px;
  left: 0px;
  right: 0px;
  bottom: 0px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: auto;
}
----
+
Alternative
+
[source,css]
----
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
----
* Containing element is the closest positioned ancestor

==== Stacking content

[NOTE]
====
`z-index` does not work in flow layouts (use positioned layout, flexbox or grid instead)

Positioned elements will always render on top of non-positioned ones

Each `z-index` creates an isolated stacking context for its descendants.
Wrapping content that stacks over others by accident into a stacking context can solve this issue.
====

[TIP]
====
Instead of creating a stacking context with `z-index`, modern browsers can use:

[source,css]
----
.stacking-container {
  isolation: isolate;
}
----
====

==== Fixed positioning

* Can only be contained by the viewport.
It doesn't care about containing blocks
* Sits at its flow position if no positioning is provided

WARNING: If a parent or grandparent uses the transform property, it becomes the containing block for the fixed element, essentially transforming it into an absolutely-positioned element

.Helper to detect ancestors that break `position: fixed`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,javascript]
----
const selector = '.the-fixed-child';
function findCulprits(elem) {
  if (!elem) {
    throw new Error(
      'Could not find element with that selector'
    );
  }
  let parent = elem.parentElement;
  while (parent) {
    const {
      transform,
      willChange
    } = getComputedStyle(parent);
    if (transform !== 'none' || willChange === 'transform') {
      console.warn(
        '🚨 Found a culprit! 🚨\n',
        parent,
        { transform, willChange }
      );
    }
    parent = parent.parentElement;
  }
}
findCulprits(document.querySelector(selector));
----
====

==== Overflow

WARNING: Scrollbars can look different on macOS based on having a wired mouse connected or not

When we set either overflow-x or overflow-y, we turn the selected element into a scroll container.
Children of a scroll container are essentially locked inside that box.

Essentially, `overflow: hidden` is an `overflow: scroll` container without the ability to scroll.

Absolute positioned elements ignore overflow properties of their ancestor elements. `overflow: auto` on the containing element solves this issue by scrolling inside of the container.

Fixed-position elements are immune from being hidden with `overflow: hidden`

==== Sticky positioning

When setting `position: sticky`, you also need to pick at least one edge to stick to (top, left, right, bottom).
Most commonly, this is done with `top: 0px`

Sticky elements take up real space, and that space remains taken even when the element is stuck to an edge during scrolling.

===== Troubleshooting

* A parent is hiding/managing overflow
** `position: sticky` can only stick in one "context".
Either it sticks to the main viewport scroll, or it sticks to an ancestor that manages overflow.
** Overflow `hidden` or `scroll` or `auto` sticks element in that context, not in the broader page context. *Check ancestors for this styling as well*

.Helper to detect ancestors that break `position: sticky` by some overflow styling
[%collapsible]
====
[source,javascript]
----
// Replace this with a relevant selector.
const selector = '.the-fixed-child';

function findCulprits(elem) {
  if (!elem) {
    throw new Error(
      'Could not find element with that selector'
    );
  }

  let parent = elem.parentElement;

  while (parent) {
    const hasOverflow = getComputedStyle(parent).overflow;
    if (hasOverflow !== 'visible') {
      console.log(hasOverflow, parent);
    }
    parent = parent.parentElement;
  }
}

findCulprits(document.querySelector(selector));
----
====

* The sticky element is stretched in flexbox/grid layout

* Thin gap above my sticky header
** Issue in Chrome due to rounding issues
+
[source,css]
----
header {
  position: sticky;
  top: -1px; /* -1px instead of 0px */
}
----

==== Hidden Content

* `visibility: hidden` can be selectively undone by children.
** All children take the space they need, but only selected ones are visible in the browser.

== Modern Component Architecture

=== Ways of styling applications

There are multiple ways of adding CSS to an application:

==== Vanilla CSS

.Pros
* No tooling means less complexity, no runtime performance costs
* CSS Custom Properties make certain tooling features redundant

.Cons
* Global and unscoped
* No vendor prefixes added
[#js-in-css]
* (_Can't share data between js and css_ 🤔)
+
.Caveat
[%collapsible]
====
Having a separation between application logic and styles in mind, passing data between js and css can lead to moving parts of the displaying logic into styled components rather than applying different styled components for different use cases.
Although this has no impact on the processed styles, the complexity and readability of the mixture between data and CSS might increase tremendously.
====

==== Sass / Less

.Pros
* Powerful tools like for-loops, mixins, and nesting
* High developer satisfaction compared with vanilla CSS

.Cons
* Requires a build step
* Remains global by nature, and isn't scoped to specific components
* Everything happens at build time

==== CSS Modules

.Pros
* Solves scoping and specificity
* Feels like writing straight-up CSS
* Offers a composes feature, to extend existing CSS classes

.Cons
* Doesn't really offer any modern convenience features, like auto prefixing (post processors needed to fix this)
* (_Hard to share data between CSS and JS_ - <<js-in-css, see Vanilla CSS cons>>)

==== Single-file components

.Pros
* Less jumping between files

.Cons
* Blows up files
* No file-based separation of styles & logic

==== Styled components

.Pros
* Solves scoping and specificity
* Offers good solutions for animations and global styles
* Extremely high developer satisfaction
* Best-in-class performance

.Cons
* Primarily a React tool
* Obfuscates the underlying markup tags, which can make it harder to get a sense of the HTML semantics at a glance

==== Tailwind (Utility first frameworks)

.Pros
* Solves scoping and specificity
* Encourages good habits when it comes to following a design system
* Can be faster to write
* Not React-specific (React based alternative: https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro[Twin])
* Highly used in the last few years

.Cons
* Relatively steep learning curve, compared to other tools
* Adds a lot of "bulk" to your markup

=== Styled Components - In Depth

* Sass-like preprocessor *stylis* adds vendor prefixes behind the scenes.
* Creates unique hash for each styled component -> no css class collisions
* https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/demystifying-styled-components/[Demistifying Styled Components]

TIP: Nested CSS (`&`) might come to https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting-1/[Vanilla CSS]

* https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/benchmarks/[Styling Variants Benchmarks]
* *Each added prop carries a significant and exponential cost in terms of complexity*
* Use compositions for variants that feel like not being generic ones
* Define contextual styles by "reaching out" to the sourrounding context
+
[%collapsible]
====
[source,typescript jsx]
----
const ButtonBase = styled.button`
  border-radius: 2px;

  ${ButtonGroup} & {
    border-radius: 0px;
  }
`;
----

_Contextual styles are defined next to the element to be styled (ButtonBase), rather than polluting the styled of the context (i.e., ButtonGroup)_
====
* When extending JSX-Components with a styled component, `className` has to be passed as a prop to the JSX-Component in order to apply the generated css class to its root-element

WARNING:  Only provide "core" options as props for styled components.
Too much options increase complexity dramatically.

.How to decide about "core" options?
****
If the Button component starts to feel too overwhelming, with too many options, consider extracting a couple composed variants to lighten the mental load.
****

== Flexbox

https://flexboxfroggy.com/[Flexbox Frog Game]

=== Basic Behaviour

* primary & cross axis
** justify-content styles primary axis
** align-items styles secondary axis
* width/height are more like hypothetical rules rather than strict styling
* Setting `width` in a flex row (or `height` in a flex column) sets the hypothetical size.
It isn't a guarantee, it's a suggestion
* `flex-basis` has the same effect as `width` in a flex row (height in a column).
You can use them interchangeably, *but `flex-basis` will win if there's a conflict*
* `flex: 1` will assign `flex-grow: 1`, but it will also set `flex-basis: 0%`.
It won't affect the default value for `flex-shrink`, which is 1

[NOTE]
====
`flex: shrink` can't shrink an item below its minimum content size.
If all the items are below their minimum content size, this property has no effect

To avoid issues between `flex` and `width` it is recommended to use the shorthand for flex in order to set the flex-basis explicitly:

.flex shorthand
[source,css]
----
.item {
/* grow | shrink | basis */
  flex: 1 1 200px;
}
----
====

[TIP]
====
Since flex-basis is a synonym for width in a flex row, we're effectively shrinking each child to have a “hypothetical width” of 0px, and then distributing all of the space between each child

.`flex-basis:0` causes growth to distribute all space evenly on elements (based on their ratio)
image::flex-distributions.jpeg[align=center,width=450]
====


* In a flex row, `flex-basis` works just like `width`, and it also respects the constraints set by `min-width` and `max-width`
* `flex-basis` helps to define the element-width base on which growing/shrinking the element should take place
+
.Example
 flex-basis: 250px -> Assume the element had a width of 250px by default. Resizing logic is based on this width.
Combining elements flex-basis to a certain screen width can trigger resized effects as desired.

=== Item vs. content

|===
|Item |Content

|Single element within flexbox container
|Group of items of a flexbox container
|===

=== Flexbox and z-index

Flexbox algorithm also supports z-index.
If our element is being laid out with Flexbox, it uses z-index as if it was rendered with positioned layout.

The same thing is true for CSS Grid; a child in Grid layout can use z-index without setting `position: relative`.

=== Center child with content around

[.float-group]
--
image:centered-mobile-nav.png[width=250, role="left"]
Sometimes there is content that should be centered in the container with other elements before/after.

One solution would be to solve this with having the surrounding elements positioned absolute. Flexbox can help here with the use of `flex: 1` to let surrounding elements grow evenly to the remaining space:

[source, html]
----
<div id="nav-container">
    <div class="filler" />
    <nav></nav>
    <footer class="filler" />
</div>
----

[source, css]
----
.nav-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.filler {
    flex: 1;
}
----
.Explanation
`.filler` on the surrounding elements of the centered content will take the share the remaining space evenly due to `flex: 1`. The remaining space is always `container-height - centered-element-height` which will result in a centered element.
--

== Responsive and Behavioural CSS
* On iOS, all browsers are secretly Safari
+
[%collapsible]
====
Google Chrome on iOS uses a WebView that defers all page-rendering to iOS Safari. In other words, iOS Chrome isn't actually a discrete browser; it's more like a Chrome-scented skin for Safari.

This policy does have one upside: we don't have to test our products on multiple browsers on iOS.
====

* *Adaptive design*: Serve _different HTML_ based on device types
* *Responsive design*: Serve _one HTML_ displayed differently based on device types

=== Mobile Quirks
==== Pixel Ratio
.window.devicePixelRatio
This number is the ratio between the physical LED pixels on the device, and the "theoretical" pixels we use in CSS. Mapping a software pixel to multiple hardware pixels happens “under the hood”.

.Ratio of 3: 10px are 30px on the device; 1px takes 3x3 pixels
image::pixel-ratio.png[width=200, align=center]

==== The meta tag
[source, html]
----
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
>
----
* width=device-width: Tells mobile devices not to scale in order to see all content rather than using the device width as a viewport width

==== Mobile Testing

[#interaction-media-queries]
=== Interaction Media Queries
* Starting in 2019, links/buttons will always trigger a click event on tap, no matter what the hover state is
* `hover` is the ability for a device to move the cursor without also triggering a click/tap on the element underneath; a mouse can do this, but your finger or a stylus can't.
* `pointer` refers to the level of control the user has over the position of the cursor

[source, css]
----
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  button:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
----

.Hover and pointer states for input devices. A "fine" pointer like a mouse or trackpad means that the user can be very precise with their clicks. Using our fingers on a touchscreen, though, is "coarse": we can't be anywhere near as precise.
image::hover-pointer.png[width=500, align=center]

=== Breakpoints
> We should put our breakpoints in dead zones, as far away from “real-world” resolutions as possible

.Breakpoints should live between device resolutions
image::mobile-breakpoints.png[align=center, width=500]

==== Defining breakpoints
Unfortunately, CSS doesn't have any built-in way to manage breakpoints. CSS has media queries, and media queries always take "raw" values (like 550px), not breakpoints.

The good news is that just about every CSS preprocessor and framework has a solution for this problem.

.Example
[%collapsible]
=====
[source, javascript]
----
// mobile-first
const BREAKPOINTS = {
  tabletMin: 550,
  laptopMin: 1100,
  desktopMin: 1500
}

const QUERIES = {
  'tabletAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.tabletMin}px)`,
  'laptopAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.laptopMin}px)`,
  'desktopAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.desktopMin}px)`
}

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  padding: 16px;
  @media ${QUERIES.tabletAndUp} {
    padding: 32px;
  }
`;
----
=====

[TIP]
====
To ensure device types for certain stylings, <<interaction-media-queries,`hover` and `pointer`>> might be better than screen size based media queries.

Using `rem` instead of `px` for breakpoints can result in a more appropriate behaviour of the application when in-/decreasing font-sizes in the browser. However, this might be confusing to think of along the way.

.Example
[%collapsible]
=====
[source, javascript]
----
const BREAKPOINTS = {
  tabletMin: 550,
  laptopMin: 1100,
  desktopMin: 1500,
}

const QUERIES = {
  'tabletAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.tabletMin / 16}rem)`,
  'laptopAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.laptopMin / 16}rem)`,
  'desktopAndUp': `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.desktopMin / 16}rem)`,
}
----
=====
====
WARNING: If you find that you need to use custom values often, it's probably a sign that your breakpoints are at the wrong spots. Well-matched set of breakpoint values should be used 80-90%+ of the time.

=== CSS Variables
NOTE: CSS variables are inherited by ancestors not globally accessible.

.To avoid inheritance use: `@property: --my-var {…}` (limited browser support):
[source, css]
----
@property --text-color {
  syntax: '<color>';
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: black;
}
----

.Most of the time CSS variables are defined on the root element which is an alias for `html`
[source, css]
----
:root {
  --color-primary: red;
  --color-secondary: green;
  --color-tertiary: blue;
}
----

.CSS Variables are composable:
[source, css]
----
 --color-primary: hsl(
    var(--pink-hue)
    var(--intense)
  );
----

.Default value for `var` as second argument:
`var(--inner-spacing, 16px);`

==== Reactivity of CSS Variables
.CSS variables are reactive, i.e they are calculated when they are use not when thy are defined:
[source, javascript]
----
button.style.setProperty('--my-var', fontSize);
----

.CSS variables can be changed based on media queries to deal with responsive designs +
[source, css]
----
/* only devices with coarse input device, e.g. fingertip */
@media (pointer: coarse) {
    html {
      --min-tap-height: 44px;
    }
  }

input {
    min-height: var(--min-tap-height, 32px);
}
----

==== Using the calc function
.calc allows to mix units
[source, css]
----
.something {
  width: calc(50% + 32px);
}
----

.calc allows to be combined with css variables
[source, css]
----
article {
  padding: var(--spacing);
  border-radius: calc(var(--spacing) / 2);
}
----

.calc can convert units
[source, css]
----
h2 {
  /* same as 1.5rem */
  font-size: calc(24 / 16 * 1rem);
}
----

==== Viewport Units
* `vh` describes the largest possible height (e.g. iOS bottom navigation is ignored)
* `vw` describes the largest possible width (e.g. scrollbars cause horizontal overflow)
* `vmin` refers to the shorter dimension
* `vmax` refers to the longer dimension

.Working with scrollbar width
[source, javascript]
----
const scrollbarWidth = window.innerWidth - document.documentElement.clientWidth;

document.documentElement.style.setProperty(
  '--scrollbar-width',
  scrollbarWidth + 'px'
);
----

==== clamp
* Works a bit like the trio of `min-width, width, and max-width`, but it combines it into a single property value
* As `clamp` is a value and not a property, it can be used so set any min/max units (e.g. paddings)

NOTE: `clamp` does behave different to min/max-width when it comes to boundaries. min/max-values of `clamp` will never overflow the width of its parent element (if defined).

.Using `min/max`
[source, css]
----
img {
    padding: min(32px, 5vw) /* works as Math.min */
    margin: max(32px, 5vw) /* works as Math.max */
}
----

==== Finding overflowing elements
.Reveal elements that overflow the viewport and cause horizontal scroll bars
[source, css]
----
*  {
outline: 1px solid /* takes up no space compared to borders */
}
----

==== Responsive Typography
* All browsers have a default font size of 16px

[TIP]
====
iOS zooms in for all input elements that have a smaller font-size than 16px

.Setting font-size for elements to avoid zooming
[source, css]
----
input, select, textarea {
  font-size: 1rem; /* in case browser font-size >= 16px */
}
----
====

.Settings typography size based on viewport.
By mixing a viewport unit with a relative unit, we give the user control over the font size once more, allowing them to crank it up
[source, css]
----
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw + 1rem, 3rem);
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
  /*
    HACK: Add this declaration if you're using Safari to see the text scale
    when resizing:

    min-height: 0vh;
  */
}
----

== Typography
* Kerning algorithms take care about spacing between characters to make text looking more "natural" (Algorithms differ across browsers)
* bitmap (images blurry on scale) vs. vectors (commonly used)
* `\&nbsp;` helps to keep text together that should not be separated by line breaks
* `hyphens: auto` only works if the lang attribute is set on the <html> tag (and it mainly only works in English
* https://www.cssfontstack.com/[CSS Font Stack] (A complete collection of web safe CSS font stacks)

[TIP]
====
`-webkit-font-smoothing` only works on MacOS, and only in Chrome/Safari/Edge (not Firefox)
====

.Limit maximum size for lines + ellipsis
[source, css]
----
p {
    display: -webkit-box;
    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
    -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin-bottom: 1em;

  column-gap: 16px;
}

p {
  break-inside: avoid; /* optional: do not break between columns */
}

=== Web Fonts
* https://fontsource.org/[Fontsource]: Easy-to-use method to install and use self-hosted web fonts
* Google fonts are easy to add, but can be slow (even with CDN) and are missing quite a few fonts
* `.otf` & `.ttf` are inteded to be used on computers not on the web, https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator[Webfont Generator] creates proper web fonts out of these formats

.Modern custom font setup with fallback for IE
[source, css]
----
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Wotfard';
  src:
    url('/fonts/wotfard-regular-italic.woff2') format('woff2'),
    url('/fonts/wotfard-regular-italic.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

=== Steps of font loading/rendering
* *The block period* +
During this time, the text will be painted in an invisible ink, so that no text is visible. It'll render the font ASAP if it becomes available during this period.
* *The swap period* +
During this time, a fallback font is rendered (the first available font in the font stack). If the web font becomes available during this period, it gets swapped in immediately.
* *The failure period* +
If the font isn't loaded during the block or swap periods, it stops trying, and will keep showing the fallback font no matter what happens with the web font.


==== Improve font loading experience
`font-display: fallback`: Features a very-short block period (about 100ms), and a moderate swap period (about 3s)

On speedy connections, it's likely that the font can be downloaded within the block period, preventing an uncomfortable flash between font families.
On very slow or intermittent connections, the fallback font is used forever, preventing a random flash between fonts seconds/minutes after the page has loaded.

TIP: https://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/[Matching fonts for swap]

==== Variable Fonts
.A font has parameters that can be tweaked to control the rendered output. The most obvious example is font weight.
[source, html]

== Icons & Images
* https://svg2jsx.com/[SVG to JSX converter]
* It is not always useful to have images `alt` attribute to describe what the images show, on interactive images (such as links on images) it might be benificial to describe what the images _does_.
* For aesthetic purposes using background images instead might to the trick.

NOTE: Images are inline elements and therefore have spacings and such by default

.Make images/videos fit container boundaries
[source, css]
----
img,
video {
  object-fit: fill; /* contain | cover | none  */
  object-position: 0% 0%; /* shift image */
}
----

=== Images and Flexbox
As images have a quite unique way of behaviour, styling images with flexbox can get tricky when it comes to dynamic dimensions. One solution to solve moste of the problems would be the following:

.Styling image containers rather than images themselves
[source, css]
----
.img-container {
  flex: 1; /* have all images of the same size  */
}

img {
  width: 100%; /* Rely on the container width */
}
----

=== Background-images & Others

* `aspect-ratio: n / m` helps to keep the ratio of images when scaling, but also any other element
* using `<picture />` instead of `<img />` allows to use multiple sources for `srcset` (fallbacks, …)
* `.avif` creates dramatically smaller images (limited browser support)
* different background-images for different devices can be achieved with `min-resolution media queries` (`-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio` on Safari) - should be used in addition to `background-size` to get the required effect
* `background-repeat: round` will prevent background images from being cut off (by scaling them down) -  `space` can be used for the same effect but with having spaces between background images rather then down-scaled versions

== CSS Grid
[NOTE]
====
In contrast to _flexbox_, css grid is focused on distributing content across two axes rather than one. In addition, css grid has no such thing as primary and secondary axis

In contrast to _table layout_, css grid has no DOM elements defining the layout - pure CSS.
====

=== Browser Support
* Supported by https://caniuse.com/css-grid[~96%] of distributed browsers
* IE 10 and 11 support CSS Grid - but an older version of the specification

=== Grid Flow & Construction
* By default, `display: grid` creates 1 new row for each element
* `grid-auto-flow: row|column` changes directions
* Unlike in Flexbox, values aren't "suggestions", they're hard limits
** Content which is too large will overflow by default
** `fr` unit solves this taking care of the dynamic column sizes (similar to `flex-grow`) and distributing over the *available space*.
** However: `fr` reacts based on its contents -> large children will cause an overflow
* `grid-template-rows | grid-template-columns` allow to define the grid pattern
** Additional children are "squeezed" into the layout
* In order to create a grid over the whole vertical space, the <<full-vertical-space, min-height trick>> needs to be applied
* `gap` can be distinguished between rows & columns by adding a second value (rows-gap | columns-gap)

.Center elements across both axis
[source, css]
----
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
  }
----

.Shorthand for repeating elements
[source,css]
----
.calendar {
  grid-template-columns: 250px repeat(5, 1fr);
}
----

==== Alignment
* `justify-content: center` looks at the contents of each row, and figure out which child is widest in order to center columns
* `justify-content` applies to the grid structure, changing the columns. `justify-items` applies to the child elements, without affecting the shape of the grid. (analog for `align-(content|items)`)

==== Areas
.Grid areas allow to assign elements to certain sections of the layout
[source,css]
----
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    'sidebar header'
    'sidebar main-content';
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 80px 2fr;
}

aside {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
header {
  grid-area: header;
}
----

==== Tracks and Lines
[source, css]
----
.box {
  /* start / end line */
  grid-column: 3 / 5;
  /* always span over all rows */
  grid-row: 1 / -1;
}
----
TIP: -1 on defined tracks will always span to the end not matter how many sections in the track are added

==== Responsive Grid
[source, css]
----
.grid {
    display: grid;
    gap: 16px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr));
}
----

.minmax(150px, 1fr)
Have each column with equal width but restricted to at least 150px

.repeat(auto-fill, …)
Have as many columns as possible with the given dimension

NOTE: Figure out how many columns we can fit at the minimum acceptable size, 150px. +
Scale up each column so that the entire horizontal space is filled.

.Avoid overflow on smaller screen sizes
[source, css]
----
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns:
      repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(150px, 100%), 1fr));
  }
----

=== Subgrids
Subgrids are currently only supported in https://caniuse.com/?search=subgrid[Firefox] introduced by css grids v2. The first version allows only direct children of grids to participate in the provided grid layout.

=== Overflow
.Solution 1: Moving the overflow
To manage overflowing content, `overflow:` should be applied directly on the grid cell

NOTE: `fr` has an exception built-in: if the grid child has `overflow: auto`, it gives the column permission to shrink below the natural width of that element. But this doesn't work recursively.

.Solution 2: Setting a minimum width
[source, css]
----
.grid {
    display: grid;
    gap: 16px;
    grid-template-columns: 175px minmax(0, 1fr);
  }
----
> The explanation here is that the minimum size of an fr unit is auto. Grid then looks at the min-content size of the item. If the item has a size (you’ve given it a width) or has something in it with a size such as an image, the min-content size might be much bigger than the share of available space you think 1fr will give you. It’s easy to think of 1fr as being “one part of the space in the grid container” when it is really one part of the space left over.

=== Grid Quirks
* grid child can use `z-index`
* `fr` on rows takes the largest row for n-fr in account to determine how large n-fr should be. Other fr values are adapted accordingly to the calculation what n-fr is
